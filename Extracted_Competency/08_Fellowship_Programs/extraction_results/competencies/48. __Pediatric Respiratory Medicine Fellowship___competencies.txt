Educational Objectives and Content:
1. General Objectives
On completion of the education program,
1. The candidate will be competent to function independently in pediatric pulmonology.
2. The candidate will acquire the requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes to be able to
recognize, investigate, and manage all respiratory diseases.
3. The knowledge base will include a broad appreciation of general pediatrics and the basic
sciences relevant to the specialty.
4. The professional characteristics to be demonstrated and developed include responsibility,
intellectual curiosity, self-appraisal, compassion, and a commitment to continuing
medical education.
5. The candidate will acquire the clinical skills to treat and counsel patients with diseases
affecting the respiratory system; this includes primary and secondary prevention and
pulmonary rehabilitation.
6. He/she will be able to supervise a clinical pulmonary function laboratory.

7. He/she will work effectively with a health care team and acquire the
skills to be an effective teacher of other physicians (including house
officers), other health care personnel and patients.
8. He/she will also learn to appraise his/her own professional
performance, to assess the medical literature critically and to maintain
his/her level of competence.
2. Specific Objectives
The following list is meant as a guideline and is not all-inclusive.
A. Knowledge:
1. Basic Sciences as they apply to pediatric respirology:
 Developmental physiology
 The embryologic development of the respiratory system and
how congenital anomalies arise.
 The basic principles of clinical genetics.
 The gross and microscopic anatomy of the lungs, pulmonary
vasculature, chest wall, and neuromuscular apparatus.
2. Respiratory physiology
 alveolar gas composition
 ventilation
 control of ventilation
 distribution of alveolar ventilation
 diffusion
 perfusion and vascular physiology
 ventilation perfusion relationships
 oxygen delivery, utilization, and transport
 CO2 transport

3. The basic principles of clinical immunology.
4.The basic principles of cellular and molecular biology.
5. The mechanisms of action of major pharmaceutical agents
with effects on the respiratory apparatus.
6. A broad knowledge of microbiology (including normal defense
mechanisms)
7. Fundamental principles of imaging techniques including nuclear
medicine and magnetic resonance (MR) studies.
8.Fundamental principles of epidemiology.
9.Clinical Sciences:
The understanding of family and psychosocial variables in the
care of children.
The understanding of pathophysiology, clinical manifestations,
differential diagnosis, general approach to prevention,
diagnosis and management, natural history and prognosis of
the following:
1. Signs and symptoms: dyspnea, cough, snoring,
hemoptysis, chest pain, cyanosis, adventitial
sounds, clubbing.
2. Abnormalities of developmental origin: e.g. pulmonary
agenesis, diaphragmatic hernia, bronchopulmonary
sequestration, bronchogenic cysts, congenital
cystadenomatoid malformation, bronchial atresia and
malacia, anomalous venous drainage, pulmonary artery
stenosis, A-V malformations, vascular rings, congenital
lobar emphysema.
3. Diseases of prematurity:
 Respiratory distress syndrome
 Bronchopulmonary dysplasia
4. Airways obstruction:

 Upper airway: e.g. epiglottitis,
laryngotracheobronchitis
 Lower airway: e.g. asthma, cystic
fibrosis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis
5. Respiratory Failure
 Acute and chronic
 Hypoxemic and hypercapneic
6. Pleural disorders
 Pleural effusions (transudative, exudative, purulent,
haemorrhagic chylous), pneumothorax, pleural
thickening
7. Mediastinum
 Mediastinitis, pneumomediastinum,
mediastinal masses
8. Neoplastic disorders
 Benign
 Malignant (primary and secondary)
9. Infectious Diseases
 Infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract
 Infections in the normal host (community acquired
and nosocomial) and in the immunocompromised
host (including HIV related infectious diseases)
 Infections caused by bacterium, virus, mycoplasma,
Chlamydia, fungus, mycobacterium (typical and
atypical), parasite.
 Extrapulmonary tuberculosis
10. Environmental diseases
 Air pollution, active and passive smoking
 Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome
