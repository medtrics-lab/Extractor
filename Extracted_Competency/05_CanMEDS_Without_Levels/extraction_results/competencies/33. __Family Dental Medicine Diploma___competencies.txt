2. Introduction
After 2015, the United Nations 8 Millennium Development Goals produced the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) Health-related SDGs are regarded as crucial streams that must and
will be monitored in order to enforce national and global accountability regarding the well-
being of the world’s population.
The World Health Organization further reiterates this message; “Health is a state of complete
physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”. It is
believed that there is a need to train dentists who are far more than just competent technicians,
of general health.
2.1 Mission
The Saudi Postgraduate Diploma in Family Dental Medicine aims to provide an educational
educational component. It emphasises the application and integration of inter-professional
approaches and basic sciences, as part of a problem-solving and evidence-based
multidisciplinary approach to care. It also advocates closer ties between dental medicine and
general medicine, forging new linkages between primary care providers and the community.
2.2 Vision
The aim of this curriculum is to identify the competencies considered essential for a family
dentist working within the Kingdom. It sets the standard in establishing a global dental program
that promotes a holistic approach to patients, based on sound principles of Interprofessional
Collaborative Care (IPCC) and social accountability.

Given the scope of practice, trainees of the Saudi Postgraduate Diploma in Family Dental
Medicine will be expected to serve as integral members of clinical teams across hospital
and community settings. They will consult on a wide variety of cases, with an emphasis on
medically compromised patients.
Training beyond the level of pre-doctoral education in clinical dentistry and applied basic and
behavioral sciences will be provided. This will enhance the development of the skills needed to
for all patient populations.
The diploma will provide participants with a broad range of knowledge, skills and behaviours
that will make them eligible for employment at the Registrar level. The Family Dental Medicine
diploma requires participants to undergo a total of 24 months supervised training in an SCFHS
approved facility.
3. Rationale for the Course
Many diseases affecting the various systems of the human body are relevant to oral health
and oral healthcare. Most dental schools still teach medicine as a separate discipline to
dentistry, although many of these diseases affecting patients relate to the individual as a
whole. A grounding in basic medical practice would ensure that a dental physician would be
able to recognize the systemic diseases that are most prevalent in the population. By providing
an overview of the clinical signs and symptoms, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis,
management, and prognosis, the aim is to provide an understanding of the implications of
a disease and its consequences on both dental management, and the impact on the patient.
A further advantage to this approach is to encourage specialists in family dentistry to work
seamlessly with their general medical practitioner colleagues.
4. Program Objectives
Graduates of the Saudi Postgraduate Diploma in Family Dental Medicine will be eligible to
work at Registrar level in Family Dentistry. After graduating, they may work independently, in a
secondary dental hospital or community setting, with remote access to specialist consultants
when necessary.
Graduates will be expected to:
• Have greater depth of medical knowledge than that covered during undergraduate dental
studies.
• Recognize and understand the pathophysiology of the most prevalent diseases in each organ
system.
• Request common special investigations when necessary, be able to interpret the results and
take appropriate action.

• Have the ability to interpret and integrate primary medical test results into dental care.
• Achieve competency in providing primary dental care services to a higher standard, based
on current evidence.
• Effectively manage medical emergencies that might arise in dental practice.
4.1 CanMEDS Framework
The SPD in Family Dental Medicine will also produce dental practitioners with the following
CanMEDS competencies:
1. Medical Expert
Dental practitioners integrate all of the CanMEDS roles, applying medical knowledge,
clinical skills and professional attitudes in their provision of patient-centred care. Medical
Expert is the central role in the CanMEDS framework.
2. Communicator
They effectively facilitate the doctor-patient relationship and the dynamic exchanges that
occur before, during and after the medical encounter.
3. Collaborator
Work within a health care team to achieve optimal patient care.
4. Manager
As integral participants in health care organisations, organising sustainable practices,
making decisions about allocating resources, and contributing to the effectiveness of the
health care system.
5. Health Advocate
Responsibly use their expertise and influence to advance the health and well-being of
individual patients, communities and populations.
6. Scholar
Demonstrate a lifelong commitment to reflective learning, as well as the creation,
dissemination, application and translation of medical knowledge.
7. Professional
Committed to the health and well-being of individuals and society through ethical practice,
professional-led regulation and high personal standards of behaviour.
5. Entry Criteria
The following entry criteria are required to successfully enrol in this diploma:
• A dental degree (e.g., BDS, DMD, DDS) from an accredited University Dental School)
• One-years’ experience in general dental practice
• Approval from employer, if applicable, and compliance with entry criteria, including
settlement of tuition fees.

6. Teaching and Learning Strategy
The program is organized in a way that helps trainees build on their knowledge and skills by
means of a variety of learning and teaching methods, taking into account that trainees will be
adult learners with different learning styles. They will also be working full-time in a General
Dental Department and progress through the modules will be largely self-directed. It is
in the trainee’s undergraduate training, so the focus will be on enhancing and advancing
these clinical skills in the various disciplines. The integration of many of the aspects of ‘family
medicine’ will be new concepts for the trainees.
In addition to the breadth of learning that working under supervision brings, a variety of specific
learning methods will be used in each module. These include self-directed e-learning modules
and reading, simulation workshops, masterclasses and regular tutorials/discussions with an
Educational Advisor.
Learning will also be driven by the trainees in initiating a number of workplace-based
assessments for each module, which will be evaluated by their Program Director or a Topic
Specialist. These assessments include Directly Observed Procedural Skills (DOPS), Mini Clinical
Evaluation Exercises (Mini CEX) and structured case reports with a reflective element. It is
essential to note that the trainee’s Program Director or a Topic Specialist is responsible for
signing off on the trainee’s clinical competency during the training period.
6.1 Theoretical Knowledge
Theoretical knowledge will be provided to trainees using various educational methods.
These include e-learning materials, discovery-based games, masterclasses, tutorials, group
discussions and regular sessions with the Educational Advisor, Program Director and other
clinical instructors. A list of recommended reading is also provided within this curriculum
document for self-study.
6.1.2 Masterclasses
These focused teaching days will be led by experts in their discipline, sharing their knowledge,
experience and insights with trainees. They may contain some hands-on elements.
6.2 Clinical Knowledge and Skills
Trainee’s clinical knowledge and skills will be reinforced throughout the program by their
supervised clinical practice, participation in simulation activities and workshops, and by the
case-based discussion sessions.
Program Curriculum 5

6.2.1 Supervised clinical practice
Topic Specialists/Demonstrators will provide guidance, evaluation and feedback on the
trainees’ clinical skills and procedures. They will also contribute in group discussion sessions.
Successful supervised clinical sessions must be recorded and verified by the Program Director
as they are a core element of a trainee’s success on the program. [See Appendix 6 for a
summary of requirements]
Simulation workshops will focus on clinical procedures and techniques, manipulation of
materials and use of equipment. This will take place with structured practical guidance and
supervised hands-on simulated activities in a phantom head laboratory. [See Appendix 3 for
workshop details]
Case-based discussions should be conducted on a regular basis (at least every two weeks)
between the trainee and their Educational Advisor or Program Director. This is to assess and
provide feedback on the trainees’ clinical judgment and decision-making, as well as his or
her ability to record information accurately and contemporaneously. Discussions will include
patient notes, referral letters and outlined treatment plans and critical thinking skills. Trainees
will be assigned an Educational Advisor to guide, discuss, evaluate and provide feedback as
they progress through the program.
6.2.2 Rotations
• Trainees will be required to spend time in a hospital-based medical radiology center,
to obtain practical knowledge and real life experience of the workings of a modern,
sophisticated hospital-based radiology service. This ties in with Oral Diagnosis and Radiology
sections of the curriculum.
• Trainees will also be required to spend time in community family medicine settings to
acquire a broad range of family medicine experience.
• Finally, trainees will be expected to spend three weeks in a hospital internal medicine
setting.
7. Program Structure
The SPD in Family Dental Medicine is delivered over a two-year period, during which time
trainees will be working in an SCFHS-accredited Dental Centre. The diploma is organized in a
content, avoiding undesirable repetition and maximizing the trainees’ learning curve.
