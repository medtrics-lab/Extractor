professional competencies. CanMEDS
represents an internationally recognized framework outlining competency roles. It has been adopted
in this curriculum as descried in (Frank JR, Snell L, Sherbino J, editors. CanMEDS 2015 Physician
Competency Framework. Ottawa: Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada; 2015)
Upon completion of training, fellows are expected to acquire the following competencies and
effectively function as medical experts.
Medical expert definition
As medical experts, subspecialists in reproductive medicine and surgery integrate all the CanMEDS
roles and apply medical knowledge, clinical skills, and professional attitudes in their provision of
patient-centered care. Medical experts play a central role according to the CanMEDS framework.
1. Function effectively as consultants, integrating all the CanMEDS roles to provide optimal,
ethical, and patient-centered medical care
1.1. Perform consultations, including the presentation of well-documented written and/or verbal
assessments and recommendations in response to requests from other healthcare
professionals
1.2. Demonstrate the use of all CanMEDS competencies relevant to reproductive medicine and
surgery
1.3. Identify and appropriately respond to relevant ethical issues that arise from patient care
1.4. Demonstrate the ability to prioritize professional duties when faced with multiple patients
and problems
1.5. Provide compassionate and patient-centered care
1.6. Recognize and respond to the ethical dimensions in medical decision-making
1.7. Demonstrate medical expertise in situations other than patient care when necessary (e.g.,
providing expert legal testimony or advising governments)
2. Establish and maintain clinical knowledge, skills, and attitudes appropriate to reproductive
medicine and surgery
2.1. Demonstrate and apply knowledge of the clinical, socio-behavioral, and fundamental
biomedical sciences relevant to reproductive medicine and reproductive surgery:
2.1.1. Embryology, anatomy, histology, physiology, and genetics of the male and female
reproductive tracts
2.1.2. Anatomy, histology, and physiology of the hypothalamic pituitary-gonadal axis, and
related endocrine functions throughout life
2.1.3. Mechanisms of reproductive hormone action and endocrine pharmacology

2.1.4. Endocrinology and immunology of pregnancy and the feto-placental unit
2.1.5. Physiology of gametogenesis, gamete transport, fertilization, embryo development,
implantation, and early pregnancy development
2.1.6. Principles of epidemiology relevant to reproductive disorders
2.1.7. Microsurgical principles as they apply to oviductal and other reproductive surgery
2.1.7.1. Principles for selection of patients and techniques of tubal re-
anastomosis after previous tubal sterilization
2.1.8. Principles of assisted reproductive laboratory techniques, including gamete culture
and micromanipulation techniques
2.1.9. Prevention and management of ART complications, including, but not limited to,
high-order multiple pregnancies, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), and
ectopic pregnancy
2.1.10. Appropriate preoperative assessment of patients
2.1.11. Etiology, diagnosis, and management of the following reproductive endocrine
disorders:
2.1.11.1. Disorders of function and physiology of the hypothalamic pituitary-
gonadal axis
2.1.11.2. Disorders of the menstrual cycle regulation throughout reproductive life
and disorders of ovulation and follicle development
2.1.11.3. Congenital anomalies of the reproductive system
2.1.11.4. Primary and secondary amenorrhea
2.1.11.5. Oligomenorrhea
2.1.11.6. Ovulatory bleeding
2.1.11.7. Hyperprolactinemia
2.1.11.8. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH)
2.1.11.9. Hypothyroidism
2.1.11.10. Hyper androgenic disorders in women, including idiopathic hirsutism,
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), congenital adrenal hyperplasia,
Cushing’s syndrome, and androgen secreting tumors
2.1.11.11. Disorders of sexual differentiation, anatomic alterations, and congenital
anatomical variations, including ambiguous genitalia, ovarian
dysgenesis, androgen insensitivity syndrome, testicular failure, and male
hypogonadism
2.1.11.12. Climacteric and menopause, including vasomotor symptoms and
osteopenia or osteoporosis
2.2. Describe the CanMEDS framework of competencies relevant to reproductive medicine and
reproductive surgery
2.3. Apply lifelong learning skills as a scholar to implement a personal program to stay up to date
and enhance professional competence
2.4. Contribute to the improvement of quality care and patient safety in reproductive medicine and
surgery, integrating the best available evidence and practices
2.5. Understand and manage aspects of genetic history and counseling, approach to
chromosome analysis, prenatal diagnosis, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, and pre-
implantation genetic screening
2.6. Understand and manage all aspects of RPL
3. Perform complete and appropriate assessments of patients
3.1. Identify and explore issues to be addressed in patient encounters, including the patient’s
context and preferences
3.2. Obtain histories that are relevant, concise, and accurate to context and preferences for the
purposes of disease prevention, health promotion, diagnosis and/or management
3.3. Perform focused physical examinations that are relevant and accurate for the purposes of
disease prevention, health promotion, diagnosis and/or management
3.4. Select medically appropriate investigative methods in a resource-effective and ethical
manner
