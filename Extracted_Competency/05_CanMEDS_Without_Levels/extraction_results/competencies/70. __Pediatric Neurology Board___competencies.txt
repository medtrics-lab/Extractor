ASSESSMENT
STRUCTURED LEARNING AND TEACHING
The SBPN program includes multiple learning opportunities for trainees. The bulk of
learning and teaching lies in clinical experience through hands-on mentoring in various
clinical settings and academic activities. Teaching opportunities are arranged through
academic activities in each training site, where the resident will be providing formal,
informal, or bedside teaching to junior or general pediatric residents. These teaching
activities should be documented in the annual academic-performance report, which is
In addition to these responsibilities, the resident is required to complete certain
structured educational modules and activities; this aspect of the learning process is
covered in the following section.
Part I: Universal Topics
These are high-value, interdisciplinary topics of the utmost importance to the trainee.
The topics are delivered to ensure that every trainee develops essential core
knowledge in medicine practice. These topics are common to all specialties.
Topics included here fall in one or more of the following classes:
Impactful: Topics that are commonly-encountered or relevant to life-threatening
situations.
Interdisciplinary: Topics that are difficult to teach in a single discipline.
Orphan: Topics that are poorly represented in the undergraduate curriculum.
Practical: Topics that trainee will encounter during hospital practice.
Development and Delivery
Core topics for postgraduate curriculum will be developed and delivered by the SCHS
through an e-learning platform. A set of preliminary learning outcomes for each topic
are under development.
The topics will be didactic in nature, with particular focus on the practical aspects of
care. These topics will have more content compared with workshops and other face-to-
face interactive sessions planned. The suggested duration of each topic is 1.50 hours.
The topics will be delivered in a modular fashion. At the end of each Learning Unit,
there will be an on-line formative assessment. These topics can be assessed in a
summative manner along with specialty examinations.
