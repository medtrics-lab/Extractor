3. Program Rotation
1- Introduction:
This is a structured, four-year postgraduate residency training program in
SB-HEMPATH. It is divided into two parts:
A. Junior residency (the first two years) and
B. Senior residency (the final two years).
The junior years (R1 and R2) are designed to provide training in basic
pathology and general hematopathology, together with rotations in a special
hematology laboratory, flow cytometry, and cytogenetics. The senior
residency years (R3 and R4) are designed to provide advanced training in
the morphology of blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes with exposure to
transfusion medicine (blood banks), molecular genetic pathology, and
clinical hematology. Additionally, trainees are given the opportunity to
their training.

--- Page 20 ---
• Residents are expected to do two blocks of four weeks each as elective
rotations in their area of interest in the final two years of their training.
• The sequence of the rotations is organized by the regional training
committee.
• Each resident must examine and assess at least 3,000 hematological
cases exhibiting an adequate level of diversity (bone marrow 500, lymph
node 50, blood film morphology and bodily fluids 1,000, special
coagulation 400, hemoglobin electrophoresis 400, serum protein
electrophoresis 50, flow cytometry 400, procedure for therapeutic
plasma pheresis and platelet and other cellular collections 10 and 20
respectively, molecular and cytogenetics 200). This requirement ensures
conditions besides sharpening their critical diagnostic skills.
• Each resident must participate in at least 10 bone marrow
aspirate/biopsy procedures during the senior years.
• Each resident must participate in at least two research activities, one as
the first author and the other as a coauthor.
• Residents should be involved in on-call coverage during weekdays and
weekends beginning in the first year of training.
• After successful completion of all program requirements throughout the
four-year training period and after obtaining a final in-training evaluation
report (FITER), the candidate will receive a training completion
certificate.
• Candidates who successfully complete the final certification examination
will be awarded a SB-HEMPATH certificate by the Saudi board.

4. Mapping of Learning Objectives and Competency
Roles to Program Rotations
Refer to Appendix B
Rotation Descriptions and Objectives:
1) Introduction to laboratory medicine (over 4 weeks):
The field of laboratory medicine in general and hematopathology
specifically is not well-known, and medical students usually do not possess
working in this field. The first rotation is intended to expose residents to the
various sections and functions of laboratory medicine, including the
following:
a- Blood collection using various tubes and sample transportation and
processing methods at various laboratories.
b- Core laboratory skills with exposure to clinical biochemistry, serology
(both infectious and immune), and routine and special microbiology.
Competencies:
1.1 Understand sample-collection techniques
1.2 Differentiate between the types of blood-collection tubes
1.3 Identify problems with the collection, transportation, and processing
