Medical Knowledge 
Definition
The family physician is competent to recall, analyze and apply  a 
broad and deep fund of knowledge to proficiently care for a 
diverse patient population with undifferentiated healthcare needs1 
Description
The medical knowledge domain is about establishing and evolving 
biomedical, clinical, epidemiological, and social-behavioral sciences as well 
as applying this knowledge to patient care. Family physicians are required to 
understand and discuss a very wide spectrum of information to meet 
patients’ diverse needs, and they are required to apply this information into 
practice correctly and efficiently.  
 Medicine is constantly evolving, and because of the unique nature of the 
specialty, the scope of knowledge expected to be covered by residents is 
insufficient for actual practice. A desire for and an understanding of the 
need for a lifelong-learning approach to the practice of FM is a requisite 
attribute for physicians providing quality healthcare. 
 Consequently, this domain seeks to ensure that residents are trained to 
continually investigate, question, and seek new knowledge; share those best 
practices with medical colleagues; and employ said knowledge in the 
diagnosis and treatment of patients by practicing appropriate decision-
making processes. 
Competencies
MK 1: Demonstrates medical knowledge of sufficient breadth and depth to 
practice FM.  
MK 2: Applies critical thinking and decision-making skills in patient care 
based on the best available information and resources.

Patient Care 
Definition
The family physician is competent to provide accessible, 
quality, comprehensive, compassionate, continuous, and 
coordinated care by using the biopsychosocial perspective and 
patient-centered model of care with patients in the context of 
family and community, not limited by age, sex, disease, or clinical 
setting.
Description
The patient care domain is about the functional competencies that are 
required by a family physician to provide services per the national MOC 
systems. The family physician should deliver these functions to all patients 
and in any setting, demonstrating the capability of ensuring patients’ safety, 
best clinical outcomes, and satisfaction. 
 The new MOC is designed based on “systems” of care, rather than 
specialties or settings. By using a system-based modeling approach, 
integration is intrinsically built into the new MOC. The six systems of care are 
selected based on the six tasks a person will have from before they were 
born, till the need to support their bereaved family after they have died: 
preventive and promotive care, maternal and child care, acute and urgent 
care, chronic care, planned care, terminal care. 
 Family physicians have key roles in all systems of the new MOC; however, 
the level of involvement varies from sole provider to only a care coordinator. 
Furthermore, family physicians should be adaptable to different clinical 
situations, master the use of time as a tool for resolving uncertainty, and 
should be capable of maintaining high-quality and comprehensive care for 
all patients.  
Competencies and sub-competencies
PC 1: Provides preventive and promotive care to all individuals and their 
families in the targeted community. 
PC 1.1: Promotes a healthy lifestyle including exercise, healthy diet, and 
avoidance of hazardous substances and behaviors. 
PC 1.2: Provides screening services according to current best practices. 
PC 1.3: Arranges and delivers Immunization and pharmacological 
interventions to targeted populations including specific interventions, 
seasonal campaigns, Hajj, school wellness programs, and traveling abroad. 
PC 1.4: Applies appropriate protocols for notification, isolation and handling 
cases with flagged or unidentified infectious diseases and participate in 
diseases surveillance to minimize risks of an outbreak. 
PC 1.5: Applies appropriate protocols to minimize microbial resistance to 
antibiotics in the community by the means of health education, counseling, 
conscious antibiotics prescription and managing antibiotic-resistant cases.

Alignment with other competency frameworks
There are several competency frameworks around the world that have 
been generated according to each country's unique healthcare system and 
the perception of physicians’ roles in those systems. Although they are 
typically similar, there are some differences in the categorization of 
competencies, the weight of each category, and the definitions of some 
competencies. 
 In this section, we highlight the similarities between the SaudiMED-FM 2020 
and other national and international frameworks (i.e., ACGME, CanMEDS, 
and SaudiMED for undergraduates (SaudiMED-UG)) to generate some sort of 
alignment to improve understanding of the SaudiMED-FM 2020 framework 
components.  
Medical knowledge 
 This This domain was adopted from the ACGME framework and resembles 
the “scientific approach to practice” competency in the SaudiMED-UG. In 
CanMEDs, this domain is covered within the “medical expert” role. 
Patient care 
 This domain was also adopted from the ACGME framework and resembles 
the “patient care” competency in the SaudiMED-UG. In CanMEDs, this 
domain is covered within the “medical expert” role. The major differences 
lay in the adoption of the new MOC in the competencies within this domain. 
Communication and collaboration 
 This domain was adopted from the SaudiMED-UG framework and 
resembles the “Interpersonal and communication skills” competency in the 
ACGME. In CanMEDs, this domain is covered within the “communicator” 
and “collaborator” roles. 
Management and Leadership 
 This domain was adopted from CanMEDs “leader” and “advocator” roles 
and resembles the “system-based practice” competency in the ACGME 
and “community-oriented practice” competency in the SaudiMED-UG. 
Professionalism 
 This domain is the best example of how frameworks are almost identical in 
some parts. This domain resembles the “professionalism” competency in the 
ACGME and SaudiMEDUG frameworks. In CanMEDs, this domain is covered 
within the “professional” role. 
Scholarship  
 This domain was adopted from CanMEDs role “Scholar” and resembles the 
“practice-based learning” competency in the ACGME and the “research 
and scholarship” competency in the SaudiMEDUG.

Clinical Rotation 
Guide 
General curriculum 
 The duration of the FM training program is 3 years. Training is structured so 
that a coherent and integrated educational program with progressive 
resident responsibility is ensured. Education is designed as a spiral curriculum: 
through a process of repetition, re-exposure, and re- emphasis, residents 
learn and continue to add to their overall knowledge and skills. 
 Training consists of two phases. The first two years (“junior”) are designed for 
training mainly in major specialties (FM I and II, internal medicine, general 
surgery (GS), pediatrics, emergency medicine, OB/GYN, psychiatry, ENT, 
dermatology, and ER). The third year (“senior”) training is mainly in FM III. 
 The rotations in the 1st and 2nd years can be taken interchangeably 
without a specific order. The curriculum rotations are categorized based on 
training processes options as follows: 
  
Full-time rotations: These should be taken in the hospital with 
the allocated specialty where the resident works as a full-time 
resident with the same duties and responsibilities of a junior 
resident from the same specialty (e.g., internal medicine, GS, 
pediatric, OB/GYN, psychiatry, emergency medicine, and 
dermatology) 
Multi-options rotations: Program administration should 
conduct these per the available resources: as a workshop, 
simulation, in weekly educational activities, or in standard 
hospital rotations (e.g., ENT, ophthalmology, radiology, 
orthopedic and musculoskeletal) 
 Below, we present different structural models of the FM curriculum. Models 
A and B present a different order of hospital rotations in years 1 and 2, while 
Model C presents hospital rotations for all major specialties without 
conducting workshops. The Program Training Committee (PTC) should 
choose the most appropriate FM program structure based on the available 
resources; thus, the program structure is not limited to the below models. In 
addition, further splitting of the long rotations to not less than 4 weeks of 
duration for each part is possible if needed.

Elective Vs Selective Rotations 
The FM curriculum several opportunities to develop residents’ KSA through 
the elective rotations, which are distributed in years 2 and 3. The FM 
curriculum stresses elective rotation to give the residents the chance to 
select some clinical rotations that might be not taken in the program (e.g., 
neurology, urology, nephrology, etc.) or to choose clinical rotations in which 
they need further training. The elective rotation has more value in the 
programs that choose to conduct workshops for multi-options rotations 
owing to bridging knowledge gaps and residents’ desire to work with 
relevant clinical specialists.  
 During the third year of the FM residency, the curriculum offers further 
selective rotation in the FM sub-specialties, which are an extension of the FM 
specialty. In case these selective sub-specialties are not feasible, the resident 
should spend the selective rotation in FM III. Upon mandatory approval from 
the director of the training program, residents can choose from the following 
list of clinical rotations as part of his/her Selective Module: 
O Geriatric care
O Home healthcare
O Adolescence medicine 
O Diabetic care
O Occupational medicine
O Palliative care 
O Woman Health
O Life Style Medicine
O Primary Mental Health
O Research ﬁeld (if the resident is going to conduct a full research thesis)
O Others (as appropriate)
Multi-options clinical rotation 
 The FM curriculum has focused on the resident to gain the needed 
competencies in the FM program. These competencies can be gained by 
scheduling the residents to rotate in the main specialties. Other 
competencies and skills can be obtained by either rotating the residents in 
these specialties (e.g., ophthalmology, ENT, radiology, orthopedic, home, 
healthcare, palliative) or conducting educational activities (workshop) that 
achieve the same outcome.  
 Workshops are designed to be intensive educational programs for a 
relatively small group of residents to gain specific competencies. It is a 
scientific event with the objective of presenting updated knowledge and to 
teach medical skills that are needed to practice FM.  
 The curriculum is designed to be flexible to residents’ needs, availability of 
resources, and readiness of the medical setting. The training administration 
shall schedule the residents in the traditional hospital rotations (example 1) or 
conduct workshops for all or some of the multi-options rotations (examples 2 
and 3) that ensures delivering the updated knowledge and gaining the 
procedural skills that match their required competencies. 
23
 SaudiMED-FM 2024 

Saudi Board for Family Medicine Curriculum 2024
Example 1 
Example 2 
Example 3 
  
 These workshops can be conducted over (around) 4 weeks per the PTC. It 
is advisable to utilize the skill labs, and activate interprofessional education 
by encouraging participation of specialities’ doctors, nurses, and other 
healthcare professionals to obtain maximum benefits from the workshop. The 
learning style of these workshops focuses on small group discussion, 
assignments, hands-on activities, and simulations. During the workshops, the 
resident is requested to perform clinical duties that enhance the learning 
objectives of the workshops in specialty clinics and/or FM clinics per the 
program administration decision; i.e., not less than 2 clinics/week and not 
more than 7 clinics/week. Furthermore, the clinical exposure of the multi-
options rotations should be merged with workshops activities to link the 
learned skills from the workshops with the clinical practice. 
On-call duties 
 On-call duties have a crucial educational impact on residents’ professional 
growth since they enhance collaboration skills with other specialties and 
polish the skills in dealing with urgent and emergency cases. Thus, on-call 
duties are mandatory in the FM curriculum. Therefore, FM residents are 
required to join clinical rotations with an assigned team and fulfil the duties 
as a full-time junior resident from the same specialty. Residents are expected 
to attend the clinic and cover the on-call duties per the Saudi commission 
rules and regulations. 
 During the third year of residency, the adult ED rotation can be merged 
with FM III, and at least 18 ED shifts (shift = 8 hours duty) should be completed

Family Medicine Rotation 
Activities description: 
FM rotations extended over the three-year span of the training curriculum 
are the core rotations in which the residents are exposed, learn, and apply 
most of the principles, knowledge, and skills related to FM. The following 
section will describe the overall outcomes required by the specialty—a further 
and detailed section that describes the appropriate milestones required 
annually will be released in 2020. The FM rotations are intended to provide FM 
residents with exposure to common FM-related conditions (i.e., emergencies, 
acute, and chronic) in the community, and to be involved in decision-making 
processes regarding assessment, diagnosis, and management of patients with 
health problems. 
Activities types: 
The following are the activity types that the residents are expected to cover 
during the FM rotations
1. FM clinics: Four hours of supervised, general FM clinic. 
2. Specialized services: Four hours of supervised, specialized services 
including well-baby clinic, antenatal care clinic, chronic diseases clinic, 
home care, mental health clinic, health promotion and disease 
prevention clinic, etc.). 
3. Urgent Care Services: Eight hours of supervised duty at an urgent care 
unit or emergency department (ED). 
Specific rules 
In the FM rotations, the FM residents must: 
O Rotate in all FM units in the FM center (FMC) or other relevant 
departments based on department structure (e.g., ANC at obstetrics 
department if the service is not actually established at the FMC)  
O Complete at least 7 clinical sessions per week. 
O Participate actively in the FMC’s academic activities including morning 
meetings, interdepartmental meetings, and tutorials.
