EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT
Overall, the evaluation and assessment of trainees is performed according to the SCFHS
training and examination rules and regulations. Assessment is divided into two parts:
a. Formative assessment
b. Summative assessment
A. Formative Assessment
The goal of the formative assessment is to monitor trainees’ learning through continuous
evaluation and feedback, which can be used by the instructors to improve trainees’ teaching
and learning. The annual criteria for formative assessment cover the three aspects of learning:
knowledge, skills, and attitude. Each learning aspect will be measured based on selected
assessment formats.
In this program, the following formats7 are selected to measure each domain.
Learning Aspects Assessment Formats
Knowledge 1- Specific Academic Tasks, including Quizzes, Case
Based Discussion* (CBD), and Seminar Evaluation**.
2- End-of-year written promotion examination
Skills 1- Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE).
2- Research activity.
3- Log book
1- Community Activities (i.e., patient safety or quality
improvement project)
Attitude *** 1- In-training evaluation reports (ITERs)
2- Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS)
*Case Based Discussion: case study of a patient cared for by the trainee in the clinical setting.
The case presentation should include:
○ Neonates medical and surgical history;
○ diagnosis/treatment history;
○ nursing diagnosis with appropriate assessment findings;
○ current neonatal nursing care plans, identifying the optimal outcomes.
