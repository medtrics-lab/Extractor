VIII. LEARNING AND
COMPETENCIES
1. Introduction to Learning Outcomes and
Competency-Based Education
Training should be guided by well-defined “learning objectives” that are
driven by targeted “learning outcomes” of a particular program to serve
specific specialty needs. Learning outcomes are supposed to reflect the
professional “competencies” and tasks that are aimed to be “entrusted” to
trainees upon graduation. This will ensure that graduates meet the
their particular specialty. Competency-based education (CBE) is an
approach of “adult-learning” that is based on achieving pre-defined, fine-
grained, and well-paced learning objectives that arise from complex
professional competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually complex and
contain a mixture of multiple learning domains (knowledge, skills, and
attitudes). CBE is expected to change the traditional method of post-
graduate education. For instance, time in training, although a precious
resource, should not be looked at as a proxy for competence (e.g., time of
achievement). Furthermore, CBE emphasizes the critical role of informed
judgment of learners’ competency progress, which is based on a staged
and formative assessment that is driven by multiple workplace-based
observations. Several CBE models have been developed for post-graduate
education in healthcare; for example, CBE by the American Society of
Health System Pharmacists (ASHP). The following are concepts to enhance
the implementation of CBE in this curriculum:

--- Page 13 ---
 Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses the
standard of the profession.
 Milestones: Milestones are stages along the developmental journey
throughout the competency continuum. Trainees throughout their
learning journey, from junior to senior levels, will be assisted in
transforming from being novice/supervised to master/unsupervised
practitioners. This should not undermine the role of
supervisory/regulatory bodies in assessing the malpractice of
independent practitioners. Milestones are expected to enhance the
learning process by pacing training/assessment to match the
developmental level of trainees (junior vs. senior).
 Learning Domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed to
(K=Knowledge, S=Skills, and A=Attitude). There may be more than one
annotation for a given learning outcome.
 Content-area Categorization: It is advisable to categorize learning
outcomes in broad content areas related to the practice of profession.
For example, diagnostic vs. therapeutic, simple vs. complex, urgent vs.
chronic, etc.
Trainees are expected to progress from the novice to the master level in a
certain set of professional competencies. This curriculum applies the
principles of competency-based medical education.
2. Program Duration
Two years
3. Program Rotations
The first year of the program consists of the following nine core rotations,
each lasting five weeks. See Appendix A for further description of each
rotation.
 Ambulatory care rotation
 Inpatient care rotation I
 Inpatient care rotation II
 Sterile preparation rotation

--- Page 14 ---
 Administration rotation
 Medication safety/ automation and informatics rotation
 Drug information rotation
 Clinical rotations:
o Introduction to clinical rotation
o Internal medicine rotation
The second year of the program consists of nine clinical rotations: six core
and three elective rotations, each lasting five weeks. For more information,
see the second-year rotations section.
 Core rotations:
Residents are expected to complete six rotations from the following
rotations, and the resident can repeat any of the core rotations as an
elective only once.
o Adult critical care rotation
o Cardiology rotation
o Infectious disease rotation
o Internal medicine rotation
 Elective rotations:
The resident can select three elective rotations from the following
rotations upon approval of the residency program director:
o Ambulatory care rotation
o Emergency medicine rotation
o General pediatrics rotation
o Hematology rotation
o Nephrology rotation
o Oncology rotation
o Pain management rotation
o Pediatric critical care rotation
o Pediatric oncology rotation
o Solid organ transplant rotation
o Surgery rotation
o Parenteral nutrition rotation

1. Longitudinal experiences:
Residents must participate in the following longitudinal learning
experiences:
a. Research project:
 The research project must be completed by the end of the second year.
 The completion of the research project is a mandatory requirement to
sit for the second-year exam and for graduation from the residency
program.
 Important notes:
o Submitting the proposal in first year:
 Submission of the research project proposal is a requirement for the
resident to be enrolled in the first-year exam.
o Submitting the abstract and evaluation of the research project in
the second year:
 The completed research must be submitted as an abstract to the
residency central committee before the end of August of the second year
for evaluation and scoring.
 The resident’s research project shall be evaluated by the assigned group
panel according to the research project assessment form.
 The research project score is a part of the formative assessment tool. Any
grade for the research project.
o Presentation in “Residents’ Research Day”:
 The research project must be presented in “Residents’ Research Day” at
the end of the second year, along with the results and conclusions of the
project. Any resident who fails to present his/her research project
without a valid excuse will not be awarded the graduation certificate.
 The project presentation will be a 10–15 minute oral presentation.
 The resident’s research project shall be evaluated by the assigned group
panel according to the research project presentation evaluation form (see
Appendix B: Research project forms) with the option of choosing the best
project(s) of the year.
o Presentation of the interim or final results at a professional
meeting is strongly encouraged.
 General guidance for research projects:
o Generating research ideas:

--- Page 16 ---
 Upon starting the residency program, the resident, along with his or her
residency training committee (RTC), will select the research project topic
for research and be assigned a research advisor.
 Attendance of a workshop on research design and methodology arranged
compulsory for all residents.
 It is the responsibility of each site’s RTC to approve the research project
topic and to supervise, along with the research mentor, the resident
during the project proposal writing.
 It is the responsibility of the resident, with the help of the RTC, to obtain
the approval of the project's site institutional review board (IRB) if
required.
o Developing a timeline for the completion of the research project
o Writing the proposal:
 All residents should follow the research project proposal format and
writing guidelines.
 The RTC is responsible for reviewing proposed research projects for
the RTC. Criteria may include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
- Scientific merit, including assessment of specific objectives,
experimental design and techniques, and likelihood of success
- Relevance/significance, including potential benefits
- Availability of resources to complete the project
- Ability (knowledge, experience, equipment, and facilities) of the
- Appropriateness to a center's focus or emphasis
- Continuing projects — evidence of productive progress
o Date collection and analysis of results:
 It is highly recommended (whenever possible) that the resident starts
working on the data collection portion of the project in the first year.
 The RTC should follow up and advise the resident during the data
collection phase and analyze the results.

4. Mapping of Learning Objectives and
Competency Roles to Program Rotations
This section aims to match the competencies, goals, and objectives related
to each rotation. Trainees and trainers should work together to achieve
these objectives during teaching and formative assessments. Expectations
should evolve as the training level progresses (training stage, milestones).
See Appendix A for descriptions of each rotation.
