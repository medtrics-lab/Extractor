## 🏆 Quality Assessment

### Extracted Content Quality
- **Structure**: Excellent hierarchical organization with numbered competencies
- **Completeness**: Full CanMEDS role coverage (Medical Expert, Communicator, etc.)
- **Detail Level**: Comprehensive with enabling competencies and sub-competencies
- **Format Consistency**: Well-formatted text suitable for analysis

### Sample High-Quality Extraction

**From Urology Board (1,663 lines extracted):**
```
5) Health Advocate

Definition:
As Health Advocates, the surgical foundations residents will responsibly use their expertise and 
influence to advance the health and well-being of individual patients, communities, and populations.

Key and Enabling Competencies: By the end of surgical foundations for urology training, the surgical 
foundations residents will able to:

1. Respond to individual patient health needs and issues as part of patient care
   1.1. Identify the health needs of an individual patient
   1.2. Recognize opportunities for advocacy, health promotion, and disease prevention with 
        individuals to whom they provide care, such as:
        1.2.1. Child abuse
        1.2.2. Elder abuse
        1.2.3. Domestic violence and spousal abuse
        1.2.4. Smoking cessation
```
