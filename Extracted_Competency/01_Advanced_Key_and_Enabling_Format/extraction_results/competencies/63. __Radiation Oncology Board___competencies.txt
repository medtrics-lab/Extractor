OUTCOMES AND COMPETENCIES
OUTCOMES AND COMPETENCIES
Adapted from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada – Objective of
Training in the Specialty of Radiation Oncology
GOALS
Upon completing training, a resident is expected to be a competent radiation oncologist capable
of assuming a consultant’s role in the specialty. The resident must acquire a working knowledge
of the theoretical basis of the specialty, including its foundations in the basic medical sciences
and research.
The specialist in radiation oncology must possess clinical competence in oncology and
technical proficiency in therapeutic uses of radiation. The radiation oncologist must have a
sound background in the sciences basic to the understanding of malignant diseases and their
treatment by radiation therapy and other modalities. The acquisition of clinical skills in-patient
assessment and management, developed by assuming responsibility for the care of both
hospitalized and ambulatory patients, must be accompanied by proficiency in planning and
executing radiation treatments utilizing external beam, intra-cavitary and interstitial radioactive
sources, and systemically administered radioisotopes.
Residents must demonstrate the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective patient-
centered care and service to a diverse population. In all aspects of specialist practice, the
graduate must be able to address issues of age, gender, sexual orientation, culture, ethnicity,
and ethics in a professional manner.
RADIATION ONCOLOGY COMPETENCIES
At the completion of training, the resident will have acquired the following competencies and will
function effectively as a:
Medical Expert
Definition
As medical experts, radiation oncologists integrate all of the CanMEDS Roles, applying medical
knowledge, clinical skills, and professional attitudes in their provision of patient-centered care.
Medical Expert is the central role of the physician in the CanMEDS framework.
Key and enabling competencies: radiation oncologists are able to…
1. Function effectively as consultants, integrating all of the CanMEDS roles to provide
optimal, ethical, and patient-centered medical care
• Perform a consultation effectively, including the presentation of well-documented
assessments and recommendations in written and/or verbal form in response to a
request from another healthcare professional
• Give an expert opinion about the use of ionizing radiation in the treatment of the patient,
including the manner in which this should be integrated with other modalities of
treatment
• Demonstrate the use of all CanMEDS competencies relevant to radiation oncology

OUTCOMES AND COMPETENCIES
• Identify and appropriately respond to relevant ethical issues arising in patient care
• Demonstrate the ability to prioritize professional duties effectively when faced with
multiple patients and problems
• Demonstrate empathetic and patient-centered care
• Recognize and respond to the ethical dimensions in medical decision-making

limited to providing expert legal testimony or advising governments, as needed
2. Establish and maintain clinical knowledge, skills, and attitudes appropriate to
radiation oncology
• Apply knowledge of the clinical, socio-behavioral, and fundamental biomedical sciences
relevant to radiation oncology. These include but are not limited to the following:
• Natural history of the full range of malignant diseases, including the etiology, pathology
and molecular aspects of such diseases and preventive measures
• Natural history and pathology of those benign conditions which may be treated by
radiation
• Anatomy of normal and tumor tissue, including its demonstration by diagnostic imaging
• Radiation physics
• Radiobiology
• Histopathological features associated with radiation’s effect on normal tissues
• Principles of radiation protection and how these are applied to the safety of patients,
health care workers, and the general public
• The role and availability of clinical trial participation as a therapeutic option in
appropriate situations
• Describe the CanMEDS framework of competencies relevant to radiation oncology
• Apply the lifelong learning skills of the Scholar Role to implement a personal program to
keep up-to-date and enhance areas of professional competence
• Contribute to the enhancement of quality care and patient safety in radiation oncology,
integrating the available best evidence and best practices
3. Perform a complete and appropriate assessment of a patient
• Identify and explore issues to be addressed in a patient encounter effectively, including
the patient’s context and preferences
• Elicit a history that is relevant, concise, and accurate to context and preferences for the
purposes of prevention and health promotion, diagnosis, and/or management
• Perform a focused physical examination that is relevant and accurate for the purposes
of prevention and health promotion, diagnosis and/or management
• Select medically appropriate investigations in a resource-effective and ethical manner
• Demonstrate effective clinical problem-solving and judgment to address patient
problems, including interpreting available data and integrating information to generate
differential diagnoses and management plans
• Demonstrate independent care of ambulatory and hospitalized patients in all aspects of
radiation oncology, including investigation, diagnosis, treatment planning, supervision of
radiation therapy, and the ongoing care of patients who have received radiation therapy
and/or treatment for malignant disease
• Recognize and treat oncologic emergencies effectively
4. Use preventive and therapeutic interventions effectively
• Implement an effective management plan in collaboration with a patient and the
patient’s family
