CanMEDS competencies relevant in RT&MI;
 Identify and respond appropriately to relevant ethical issues arising in patient care;
 Prioritize professional duties appropriately and effectively when facing multiple patients
and problems;
 Demonstrate compassionate patient-centered care.
2. Establish and maintain clinical and technical radiological knowledge, skills, and attitudes
appropriate for RT&MI:
 Apply knowledge of clinical, socio-behavioral, and fundamental biomedical sciences
relevant in RT&MI specialties, including:
○ The characteristics of all RT&MI types, including but not limited to physical and
technical aspects, patient positioning, and use of contrast media;
○ Theoretical, practical, and legal aspects of radiation safety, including but not limited
to alternative imaging techniques and their possible harmful side-effects;
