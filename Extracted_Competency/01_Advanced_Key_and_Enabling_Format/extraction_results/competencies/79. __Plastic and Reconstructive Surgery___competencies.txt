competency framework
Goals
Upon completion of training, a resident is expected to be a competent specialist in plastic surgery,
capable of assuming a consultant’s role in the specialty. The resident must acquire a working
knowledge of the theoretical basis of the specialty, including its foundations in the basic medical
sciences and research.
Residents must demonstrate the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective patient-
centered care and service to a diverse population. In all aspects of specialist practice, the graduate
must be able to address issues of gender, sexual orientation, age, culture, ethnicity, and ethics in a
professional manner.
Junior Plastic Surgery Resident (R3 and R4)
The overall objective of this stage is to expose the resident to all fields of plastic surgery. During the
first 2 years (R3 and R4), the resident will be supervised when performing simple and less complicated
procedures and allowed to participate in major plastic procedures. The resident will rotate for 3
rotation blocks in the approved centers of the regional program. The resident can rotate in the same
center more than once, based on the requirements of the program and the decision of the program
director.
The plastic surgery R3 and R4 residents may take calls as senior or junior residents, depending on the
individual center policy.
Senior Plastic Surgery Resident (R5 and R6).
At this stage the resident should acquire the skills and the knowledge to become a competent plastic
surgeon at the time of graduation.
The resident rotates for a minimum of 6 blocks rotations in the approved centers of the regional
program. He/she can however, rotate in the same center more than once based on the requirements
of the program. Rotations length can be changed to 3 blocks period if the program director sees a
benefit in that for the resident.
The resident should also fulfill the role of the chief resident of the division of plastic surgery in any of
the recognized training hospital for at least 6 blocks prior to graduation.
