Competency Framework
The Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists (CanMEDS) framework, which is
applied in postgraduate training programs in many countries, offers a model of physician
competencies that emphasizes not only medical expertise but also multiple additional non-
medical expert roles that aim to competently serve society’s needs. Therefore, the Saudi
Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) is adopting the CanMEDS framework to establish
a core curriculum for all training programs including that of the Saudi Board Certification in
Addiction Psychiatry. Therefore, at the completion of training the fellow will have acquired the
following competencies and will function effectively in each of the CanMEDS role described
below.
Medical Expert
Definition
As Medical Experts, addiction psychiatry physicians integrate all the CanMEDS roles, applying
medical knowledge, clinical skills, and professional values in their provision of high-quality and
safe patient-centered care. Medical Expert has the central physician role in the CanMEDS
Framework and defines the physician’s clinical scope of practice.
Description
As Medical Experts who provide high-quality, safe, patient-centered care, physicians draw upon
an evolving body of knowledge, their clinical skills, and their professional values. They collect
and interpret information, make clinical decisions, and carry out diagnostic and therapeutic
interventions within their scope of practice and with an understanding of the limits of their
expertise. Their decision-making is informed by best practices and research evidence and
considers the patient’s circumstances and preferences as well as the availability of resources.
Their clinical practice is up-to-date, ethical, and resource efficient, and is conducted in
collaboration with patients and their families, other health care professionals, and the
community. The Medical Expert Role is central to the function of physicians and draws on the
competencies included in the Intrinsic Roles (Communicator, Collaborator, Leader, Health
Advocate, Scholar, and Professional).
Key Competencies
Addiction psychiatry physicians are able to:
1. Function effectively as consultants, integrating all of the CanMEDS Roles to provide
optimal, ethical and patient-centered medical care
2. Establish and maintain clinical knowledge, skills, and attitudes appropriate to addiction
psychiatry
3. Perform complete and appropriate patient assessments
4. Use preventive and therapeutic interventions effectively
