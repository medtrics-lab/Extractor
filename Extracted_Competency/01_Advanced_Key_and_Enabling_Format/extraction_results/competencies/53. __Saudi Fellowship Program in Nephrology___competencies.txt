COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK
Adapted from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada - Objectives of Training
in the Subspecialties of Adult and Pediatric Nephrology.
At the completion of training, the fellow will have acquired the following competencies and will
function effectively as a:
Medical Expert
Definition:
As Medical Experts, nephrologists integrate all of the CanMEDS roles, applying medical
knowledge, clinical skills, and professional attitudes in their provision of patient-centered care.
Medical Expert is the central physician role in the CanMEDS framework.
Key and Enabling Competencies: Nephrologists are able to…
1. Function effectively as consultants, integrating all of the CanMEDS roles to provide
optimal, ethical and patient-centered medical care.
1.1. Perform a consultation effectively, including the presentation of well-documented
assessments and recommendations in written and/or verbal form in response to a
request from another health care professional.
1.2. Demonstrate effective use of all CanMEDS competencies relevant to nephrology.
1.3. Identify and appropriately respond to relevant ethical issues arising in patient care.
1.4. Demonstrate the ability to prioritize professional duties effectively when faced with
multiple patients and problems.
1.5. Demonstrate compassionate and patient-centered care.
1.6. Recognize and respond to the ethical dimensions in medical decision-making.
1.7. Demonstrate medical expertise in situations other than patient care.
2. Establish and maintain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes of the clinical, socio-
behavioral, and fundamental biomedical sciences appropriate to nephrology.
2.1. Apply knowledge of the clinical, socio-behavioral, and fundamental biomedical
sciences relevant to nephrology.
2.1.1. The anatomy and histology of the kidney, including the structure and function
of the glomerular filtration barrier.
2.1.2. The physiology and pathophysiology of:
2.1.2.1. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration.
2.1.2.2. Regulation of acid-base, electrolyte, and water homeostasis.
