OBJECTIVES OF TRAINING IN UROLOGY 
OBJECTIVES OF TRAINING IN UROLOGY 
 
DEFINITION  
 
Urology is the surgical branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, and 
treatment of abnormalities and diseases of the genito-urinary tract of the male and 
urinary tract of the female, in adults and children.  
 
GOALS  
 
Upon completion of training, residents are expected to be competent specialists in 
urology, capable of assuming the role of consultants in the specialty. Residents must 
acquire working knowledge of the theoretical basis of the specialty, including its 
foundations in the basic medical sciences and related research. Urology residents must 
understand the normal function and pathological processes and diseases that affect 
the adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra in the male and female, and 
the prostate and external genitalia of the male. This includes an understanding, 
appropriate to the practice of urology, of normal development and embryology, 
biochemistry and pharmacology, physiology, anatomy, and gross and microscopic 
pathology of the genito-urinary tract.  
 
Residents must acquire the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective 
patient-centered care and service to a diverse population. In all aspects of specialist 
practice, graduates must be able to address issues of gender, age, culture, religion, and 
ethnicity, in an ethical and professional manner. A close, integrated and collaborative 
relationship with primary care physicians is essential. Collaborative relationships with 
specialists in all fields of surgery, medicine, laboratory medicine, radiology, 
rehabilitation medicine, and social work are also needed.  
 
The professional characteristics to be demonstrated and developed include all of the 
CanMEDS competencies.
