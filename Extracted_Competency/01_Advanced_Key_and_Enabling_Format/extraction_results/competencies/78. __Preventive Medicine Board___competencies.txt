STRUCTURE OF THE 
TRAINING PROGRAM 
The SBPM program has five major areas of activity: 
1) Academic training 
2) Clinical training (Hospital rotations and longitudinal clinical preventive 
clinics) 
3) Field rotations (mandatory and elective) 
4) Research 
5) Weekly academic half-days 
These activity areas are designed to train preventive medicine specialists 
who are ready to begin practice. The educational objectives help to ensure 
that all elements of the board examinations are met. 
The training year is divided into six rotations. The rotation duration is 2 
months. Each rotation consists of a group of academic courses or a 
hospital/field rotation. During all rotations, 1 day per week is dedicated to 
academic activities and protected time for research. 
In each training year, there will be one elective rotation, the content of which 
will depend on the year of training, the training spots available at the training 
center, and most importantly, each resident’s competency achievement 
progress. It can be utilized for mass gathering rotation, fulfilling promotion 
requirements, data collection for required research projects, or remediation 
of failed rotations. Throughout the entire program (4 years of training), one 
elective rotation should be a mass gathering (Hajj and Omrah) rotation. 
Elective rotations during the other years should be decided by each resident’s 
program training committee.
