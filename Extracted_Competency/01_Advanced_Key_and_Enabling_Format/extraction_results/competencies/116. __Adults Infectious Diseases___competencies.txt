Communicator
Definition
As Communicators, physicians effectively facilitate the doctor–patient relationship and the
dynamic exchanges that occur before, during, and after a medical encounter.
Description
Physicians enable patient-centered therapeutic communication through shared decision
making and effective dynamic interactions with patients, families, caregivers, other
professionals, and important other individuals. The competencies of this Role are essential
for establishing rapport and trust, formulating diagnoses, delivering information, striving for
mutual understanding, and facilitating a shared plan of care. Poor communication can lead to
undesired outcomes, whereas effective communication is critical for optimal patient
outcomes. The application of these communication competencies and the nature of the
doctor–patient relationship vary for different specialties and forms of medical practice.
Elements
 Patient-centered approach to communication
 Rapport, trust, and ethics in the doctor–patient relationship
 Therapeutic relationships with patients, families, and caregivers
