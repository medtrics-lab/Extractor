professional competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually complex and
contain a combination of multiple learning domains (knowledge, skills, and
attitudes). The CBE approach is expected to alter them. Several CBE models
have been developed for postgraduate education in healthcare (e.g.,
CanMEDS by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada
(RCPSC), the CBME-Competency model by the Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), tomorrow’s doctor in the UK, and
multiple others). The concepts below are to enhance the implementation of
CBE in this curriculum.
Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses one’s
potential to perform efficiently in a given situation based on professional
standards. Professional roles (e.g., clinician-investigator experts, health
advocates, communicators, leaders, scholars, collaborators, and
professionals) are used to define competency roles to make them manageable
for learning and assessment.
Milestones: Milestones are the stages along the developmental journey
throughout the competency continuum. Trainees will be assisted throughout
their learning journey at the junior and senior levels to transform from novice or
supervised practitioners into master or unsupervised practitioners. This should

not undermine the role of supervisory and regulatory bodies in independent
practitioners’ malpractice. Milestones are expected to enhance the learning
process by pacing training and assessment to match the developmental level
of the trainees (junior versus senior).
Learning Domains: Whenever possible, efforts are directed to annotate
learning outcomes with the corresponding domain (K = Knowledge, S = Skills,
and A = Attitudes). More than one annotation may exist for a given learning
outcome.
Content-area Categorization: Learning outcomes should be categorized into
broad content areas related to professional practice. Examples of these
categories include diagnostic versus therapeutic, simple versus complex, and
acute versus chronic.
Trainees are expected to progress from a novice to a mastery level in a set of
professional competencies. SCFHS endorses the CanMEDS to articulate
professional competencies. This curriculum applies the principles of
competency-based medical education. CanMEDS/ACGME/OTHER represents
a globally accepted framework outlining competency roles. The CanMEDS
2015/ACGME 2018 Framework” has been adopted in this section.
