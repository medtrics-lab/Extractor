professional competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually complex and
contain a mixture of multiple learning domains (knowledge, skills, and
attitude). CBE is expected to change the traditional method of
postgraduate education. For instance, the time of training, though a
precious resource, should not be considered a proxy for competence (e.g.,
time of rotation in certain hospital areas is not the primary marker of
competence achievement). Furthermore, CBE emphasizes the critical role
of informed judgment in learners’ competency progress, based on a
staged and formative assessment driven by multiple workplace-based
observations. The CBE model—developed for postgraduate education in
healthcare (CanMEDS) by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of
Canada (RCPSC)—has been adopted by the Vascular Neurology program.

The following concepts enhance the implementation of CBE in this
curriculum:
• Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses the
potential to perform efficiently in a given situation based on the
profession’s standards. Professional roles (e.g., medical expert,
health advocate, communicator, leader, scholar, collaborator, and
professional) are used to define competency roles to make them
suitable for learning and assessment.
• Milestones: Milestones are the stages of the developmental journey
throughout the competency continuum. Trainees throughout their
learning journey, from junior to senior levels, will be assisted in
transforming from (novice/supervised) to (master/unsupervised)
practitioners. This should not undermine the role of
supervisory/regulatory bodies regarding the malpractice of
independent practitioners. Milestones are expected to enhance the
learning process by pacing training/assessment to match the
developmental level of the trainees (junior vs. senior).
• Learning Domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed to
annotate the learning outcomes with the corresponding domain (K =
Knowledge, S = Skills, and A = Attitude). There might be more than one
annotation for a given learning outcome.
• Content-Area Categorization: It is advisable to categorize learning
outcomes in broad content areas concerning the practice of the
profession. For example, diagnostic versus therapeutic, simple versus
complex, and urgent versus chronic.
• Trainees are expected to progress from the novice to mastery level in
certain professional competencies. The SCFHS has endorsed
CanMEDS to articulate professional competencies. This curriculum
applies the principles of competency-based medical education.
CanMEDS is a globally accepted framework that outlines competency
