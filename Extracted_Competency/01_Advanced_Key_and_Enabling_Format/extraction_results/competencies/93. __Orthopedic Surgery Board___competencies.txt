Rationale
The responsibility of the orthopaedic surgeon is to maintain and restore proper function of the
musculoskeletal system in patients of all ages. There are various subspecialties or subdivisions
including fractures, arthritis, soft-tissue processes, tumors, metabolic conditions, congenital disorders,
and acquired conditions. A resident in orthopaedic surgery is exposed to various aspects of the
specialty, with a variety of experiences ranging from outpatient clinical practice, emergency room
situations, and hands-on operative exposure.
Upon completion of training, a resident is expected to be a competent specialist in orthopaedic surgery
capable of assuming a consultant’s role in the specialty. The resident must acquire a working
knowledge of the theoretical basis of the specialty, including its foundations in the basic medical
sciences and research. The resident must also demonstrate a satisfactory knowledge of the principles
common to all types of surgical practice.
Residents must demonstrate the requisite knowledge, skills, and attitudes for effective patient-
centered care and service to a diverse population. In all aspects of specialist practice, the graduate
must be able to address issues of gender, age, and ethics in a professional manner.
