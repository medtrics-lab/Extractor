INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
In recognition of the importance of improving and enhancing the current curriculum to meet changes
in the field, and to incorporate extensive and diversified clinical experiences, exposure to new
knowledge, practical training in basic science and clinical research, evidence-based practice, and
CanMEDS Physician Competency Framework. This Framework outlines the knowledge, skills, and
abilities that physicians need for better patient outcomes. It is based on the seven roles that all
physicians need to play in order to be better doctors: Medical Expert, Communicator, Collaborator,
Manager, Health Advocate, Scholar, and Professional.[3]
This handbook serves as an introduction to the Neurology Residency Program. It contains contact
information for the Residency Program Committee, a detailed description of the Program goals and
objectives, the educational curriculum, an outline of clinical rotations from R1 to R4, and other
important guidelines. We hope you will find this handbook useful and informative.

STRUCTURE OF NEUROLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM
STRUCTURE OF NEUROLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM
The Saudi board program in “Neurology” consists of four years of full-time supervised residency
Block R1 R2 R3 R4 R5
training in adult neurology preceded by a full year of internal medicine training, a total of five years.
The training institution must be accredited by SCFHS for a Saudi Specialty Certification in Neurology.
The Saudi Board in Neurology Residency Training Program is divided into two levels of two years each:
Junior and senior levels.
The roadmap for the rotations, which is presented below, must be followed strictly. However, the
sequence of rotations within each level can be changed according to the individual’s needs.

STRUCTURE OF NEUROLOGY TRAINING PROGRAM
The residency training year starts on October 1st annually and ends on September 30th.
Each block is four weeks.
* The neuroradiology rotation must be taken during the last six blocks of R2.
**Specialty clinics: Multiple sclerosis, Movement disorders, Epilepsy, Stroke prevention, Headache,
etc.
***Elective blocks can be used for Neuro-ophthalmology and Neuropathology if available.
• R1 Rotations:
R1 internal medicine residents who applied and accepted in the neurology program; program directors need to
take in consideration to fulfil the R1 neurology rotations before the end of academic year namely arrange for
psychiatry and neurosurgery blocks.
• Neurology clinic rotations (R2-R4)
Residents are required to attend minimum of 3 half day clinics per week. The clinic rotation is supervised by
neurology consultant or specialist.
Clinics can be general neurology or specialized clinics.
• Neurology speciality clinic (R5)
Residents will cover speciality clinics and inpatients service.
Resident should manage his/her time in order to cover both services efficiently.
The aim is to prepare the residents for future career as a general neurologist.
• EEG and EMG:
Residents need to fulfil the requirements of these rotations including DOPS and log book
