VIII. LEARNING AND COMPETENCIES
1. Introduction to Learning Outcomes and
Competency-Based Education
Training should be guided by well-defined “learning objectives” that are
driven by the targeted “learning outcomes” of a particular program to serve
specific specialty needs. Learning outcomes are supposed to reflect the
professional “competencies” and tasks that are aimed to be “entrusted” to
trainees upon graduation. This will ensure that graduates meet the expected
particular specialty. Competency-based education (CBE) is an “adult-
learning” approach based on achieving pre-defined, fine-grained, and well-
competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually complex and
contain a mixture of multiple learning domains (knowledge, skills, and
attitude). CBE is expected to change the traditional way of postgraduate
education. For instance, the time of training, though a precious resource,
should not be taken as a proxy for competence (e.g., time of rotation in certain
hospital areas is not the primary marker of competence achievement).
Furthermore, CBE emphasizes the critical role of informed judgment of
learners’ competency progress, which is based on a staged and formative
assessment that is driven by multiple workplace-based observations.
Several CBE models have been developed for postgraduate education in
healthcare (e.g., CanMEDS by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeon of
Canada (RCPSC), the CBME-Competency model by the Accreditation Council
for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), Tomorrow’s Doctor in the UK, and
multiple others). The following are concepts that enhance the implementation

of CBE in this curriculum:
• Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses the
standard of the profession. Professional roles (e.g., Expert, Advocate,
Communicator, Leader, Scholar, Collaborator, and Professional) are
in learning and assessment.
• Milestones: Milestones are stages of the developmental journey
throughout the competency continuum. Trainees throughout their
learning journey, starting from the junior level and throughout the
senior levels, will be assisted in transforming from
(novice/supervised) to (master/unsupervised) practitioners. This
should not undermine the role of supervisory/regulatory bodies in
addressing the malpractice of independent practitioners. Milestones
training/assessment to match the developmental level of trainees
(junior vs. senior).
• Learning Domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed to
annotating the learning outcomes with the corresponding domain (K =
Knowledge, S = Skills, and A = Attitude). More than one annotation
might be used for a given learning outcome.
• Content-area Categorization: It is advisable to categorize learning
profession, such as diagnostic versus therapeutic, simple versus
complex, and urgent versus chronic.
Trainees are expected to progress from the novice to the mastery level in a
certain set of professional competencies. The SCFHS endorses the CanMEDS
to articulate professional competencies. This curriculum applies the
principles of competency-based medical education. As CanMEDS represents
globally accepted frameworks that outline competency roles, the “CanMEDS

2. Program Duration
The Diagnostic Radiology Residency Training Program is a 4-year (R1 through
R4) full-time residency in accredited institutions, with continuous and final
evaluations by way of examinations.
3. Program Rotations
The Diagnostic Radiology Residency Training Program has adopted the 4-
week-block format since the 2020 training year. There are 13 rotations per
training year and 52 rotations for the entire period of the training program.
Each training year starts on October 1st.
The following table shows the distribution of radiology rotations over the four
training years.

Body CT Scan 2 a 2 1 1 6

b. Preferably 2 rotations back-to-back
c. Includes MSK US
d. Includes Vascular US
e. Must include at least one of the following (either in R3 or R4): Obstetric US, Vascular
Imaging, or Head and Neck Imaging. The AIRP course is optional and can replace any of the
three elective blocks.
f. May include physics, reporting skills, non-interpretive skills, research basics, QI basics,
and/or other courses/workshops.
Residents are entitled to four weeks of annual leave. Please refer to Section
XIII (Policies and Procedures) for further details.

4. Mapping of Learning Objectives and Competency
Roles to Program Rotations
4.1 Non-Medical Expert Roles
Learning objectives pertinent to non-medical-expert CanMEDS competency
roles are nearly the same across different radiology program rotations. The
type.
4.1.1 Communicator
• Demonstrates respectful and effective response to consultation/imaging
requests: S, A
o R1-R2: Assesses and clearly responds to consultation/imaging
requests; seeks help from seniors whenever appropriate. S, A
o R1-R2: Assembles relevant clinical information pertinent to the
requested imaging study/procedure. S, A
o R3-R4: Discusses and assesses understanding of recommendations
when providing consultation. S, A
• Respectfully discusses the imaging study/procedure with the supervising
information in an organized manner: S, A
o R1: Relates patient data and relevant medical history to the
radiological findings. S, A
o R2: Relates clinical findings and results of investigations to the
radiological findings. S, A
o R3-R4: Relates clinical findings, results of investigations, and multi-
modality imaging results to the radiological findings. S, A
