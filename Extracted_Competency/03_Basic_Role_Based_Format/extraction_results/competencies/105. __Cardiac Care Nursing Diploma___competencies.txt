VII. LEARNING AND
COMPETENCIES
1. Introduction to learning outcomes and
competency based-education
Training should be guided by well-defined “learning objectives” that
are driven by targeted “learning outcomes” of a particular program to serve
specific specialty needs. Learning outcomes should reflect the
professional “competencies” and tasks that are aimed to be “entrusted”
and tasks that trainees aim to engage in upon graduation. This ensures
patient care in relation to their specialties. Competency-based education
(CBE) is an approach of “adult-learning” that is based on achieving pre-
defined, fine-grained, and well-paced learning objectives that are driven
from complex professional competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually complex
and contain a mixture of multiple learning domains (knowledge, skills, and
attitudes). CBE is expected to change traditional methods of postgraduate
education. For instance, the time of training, though a precious resource,
should not be considered a proxy for competence (e.g., time of rotation in
achievement). Furthermore, CBE emphasizes the critical role of informed
judgment in learners’ competency progress, based on a staged and
formative assessment driven by multiple workplace-based observations.
Several CBE models have been developed for postgraduate healthcare
education.
Several CBE models have been developed for postgraduate
healthcare education including The New Zealand Cardiac Nursing (NZCN)
Knowledge and Skills Framework. This framework was selected because
context of specialized cardiac care nursing. This framework provides
exceptional knowledge, skills, and attitudes for nurses caring for patients

with acute and chronic cardiac diseases. The following concepts enhance
the implementation of CBE in the curriculum.
• Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses
one’s potential to perform efficiently in a given situation based on
professional standards. Professional roles (e.g., medical experts,
health advocates, communicators, leaders, scholars, collaborators,
and professionals) are used to define competency roles to make them
mendable for learning and assessment.
• Milestones: Milestones are the stages of the developmental journey
throughout the competency continuum. Throughout their learning
journey from junior and senior levels, trainees will be assisted in
transforming from novice/supervised to master/unsupervised
practitioners. This should not undermine the role of
supervisory/regulatory bodies towards malpractice of independent
practitioners. Milestones are expected to enhance the learning process
by pacing training/assessment to match the developmental level of the
trainees (junior vs. senior).
• Learning-domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed to
(K=Knowledge, S=Skills, and A=Attitude). You may have more than
one annotation for a given learning outcome.
• Content-area categorization: It is advisable to categorize learning
profession. Examples include diagnostic vs. therapeutic, simple vs.
complex, and urgent vs. chronic.
• Trainees are expected to progress from a novice level to a master’s
level in a certain set of professional competencies.
The New Zealand Cardiac Nursing (NZCN) Knowledge and Skills
Framework (2018-CV-Nursing-Skills-and-Knowledge-Framework.pdf
(cardiacsociety.org.nz) by the cardiac clinical nurses who are affiliated to
the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) was used as
a competency framework in this curriculum.
2. Program Durations
• The Advanced Practice Nursing Program in Adult Cardiac Care is a
two calendar year program.

--- Page 19 ---
• The program consists of 52 weeks per calendar year including a 5-
weeks of leaves.
• A total of 48 hours of didactic and clinical sessions must be completed
every week.
• Trainees may complete clinical rotations as an eight-hour shift per day,
excluding a lunch break, or as a 12-hour shift, to complete a total of no
more than 40 hours per week.
• The trainees are expected to complete certain numbers of night and
• The language of instruction for the program is English.
Leaves & vacations
• The trainee is entitled to annual leave for four weeks, in addition to one
of the two Eid holidays, according to the training institution standards.
• Sick leave, maternity leave, and exceptional “emergency” leave for a
period not exceeding 90 days shall be compensated for with an
equivalent number of days before the trainee is awarded the Certificate
of Training Completion.
• Leaves not utilized in due time within the year shall not be shifted to
the following year.
Please Refer to the SCFHS policies for more specific details for all
3. Program rotations
Table 1: Clinical Rotations for Cardiac Nursing Diploma Program:
The (NZCN) Knowledge and Skills Framework was used to review and
develop cardiac diploma rotations. The framework delineates the key
practice roles. These competencies include leadership, physiology and
pathophysiology, assessment, diagnostics, and health education / cardiac
rehabilitation /risk modification. Cardiac nurses perform these
competencies in acute cardiac care and Chronic Heart Disease.

4. Mapping of learning objectives and
This section aims to match the competencies and objectives of each
rotation to map the competencies, learning domains, and milestones.
Trainees and trainers should collaborate to achieve these objectives
during teaching and formative assessments. Their expectations evolved
as the training level progressed (training stage and milestones).
Table 2 reflects the Junior-level Competency Metrix to map
competencies, learning domains, and milestones, while Table 3 reflects
the Senior-level Competency Metrix to map competencies, learning
domains, and milestones.
Five levels or degrees of competency were used to guide the training
faculty in making decisions about the trainees’ clinical progress throughout
their training period (Table 4). These levels are also useful for evaluating
the trainees’ readiness to provide competent cardiac nursing care under a
certain level of supervision until they become independent. The five levels
were as follows (Tanner et al., 2020):
• Level 1 ‘trainee is able to observe.’
• Level 2 ‘trainee is able to perform the activity under direct supervision.’
• Level 3 ‘trainee can perform the activity under indirect supervision. The
immediately.
• Level 4 ‘trainee is able to perform the activity under distant supervision.
A supervisor was available over the phone.
• Level 5 ‘trainee is able to supervise others in performing the activity.
