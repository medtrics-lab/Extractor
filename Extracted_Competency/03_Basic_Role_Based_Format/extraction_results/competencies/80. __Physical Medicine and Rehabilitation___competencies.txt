professional competencies. The
SCFHS has endorsed the Canadian Medical Education Directives for Specialists’ (CanMED)
framework of articulating professional competencies. The following is a general outline of each
competency.
(Adopted from the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada 2020) (5)
Medical Expert
Definition:
As Medical Experts, physiatrists integrate all of the CanMED roles, applying medical Knowledge,
clinical skills, and professional values to their high-quality and safe Patient-centered care. A Medical
Expert is the central physician role in the CanMED Framework and defines the physician’s clinical
scope of practice.
Key and Enabling Competencies: Physiatrists are able to:
1. Practice medicine within their defined scope of practice and expertise
1.1. Demonstrate a commitment to high-quality care of their patients
1.2. Integrate the CanMED intrinsic roles into their practice of physiatry
1.3. Apply knowledge of the clinical and biomedical sciences relevant to physiatry
