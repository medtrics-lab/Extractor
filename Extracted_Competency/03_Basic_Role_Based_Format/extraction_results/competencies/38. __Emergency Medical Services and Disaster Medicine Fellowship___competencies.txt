VIII. THE SAUDI EMS
AND DM FELLOWSHIP
1. Learning Outcomes
Learning outcomes are descriptions of an educational program’s
results, while competencies are descriptions of the graduates. The
former is more detailed and specific, while the latter tends to be a
general statement about a graduate. We chose to describe this
fellowship using learning outcomes since DM and EMS are relatively
new.

be able to:
1. Design an EMS system that values service and clinical quality,
improvement, resilience, accountability, and economy in an
emerging healthcare system’s context.

integration with public safety, public health, and healthcare.
1.2. Depict a patient’s journey through an EMS episode of care
and highlight opportunities for improvement.
1.3. Justify alterations to the point of entry (POE) for emergency
