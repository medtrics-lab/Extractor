VIII. LEARNING AND
COMPETENCIES
1. Introduction to Learning Outcomes and
Competency-Based Education
Training should be guided by well-defined “learning objectives” driven
by targeted “learning outcomes” of a particular program to serve
specific specialty needs. Learning outcomes are supposed to reflect
the professional “competencies” and tasks to be “entrusted” by
trainees upon graduation. This will ensure that graduates meet the
particular specialty. Competency-based education (CBE) is an “adult
learning” approach based on achieving predefined, fine-grained, and
well-paced learning objectives driven by complex professional
competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually
(knowledge, skills, and attitude). CBE is expected to change the
traditional method of postgraduate education. For instance, although
it is a precious resource, training time should not be considered a
proxy for competence (e.g., rotation time in certain hospital areas is
not the primary marker of competence achievement). Furthermore,
CBE emphasizes the critical role of an informed judgment of learners’
driven by multiple workplace-based observations. Several CBE
models have been developed for postgraduate healthcare education,

for example, Critical Care Networks – National Nurse Leads )CC3N).
The CC3N framework was designed to move the learner through a
independent practitioner.
The following are concepts to enhance the implementation of CBE in
this curriculum:
 Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses
the profession's standard. Professional roles (e.g., experts,
advocates, communicators, leaders, scholars, collaborators, and
professionals) are used to define the competency role and make it
mendable for learning and assessment.
 Milestones: Milestones are the stages of the developmental
journey throughout the competency continuum. Trainees
throughout their learning journey, from junior and senior levels,
will be assisted in transforming from being novice/supervised to
master/unsupervised practitioners. This should not undermine
the role of supervisory/regulatory bodies toward the malpractice
of independent practitioners. Milestones are expected to enhance
the learning process by pacing training/assessment to match the
developmental level of the trainees (junior vs. senior).
 Learning Domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed
(K=Knowledge, S=Skills, and A=Attitude). You may have more than
one annotation for a given learning outcome.
 Content-area Categorization: It is advisable to categorize the
of the profession—for example, diagnostic versus therapeutic,
simple versus complex, and urgent versus chronic.
Trainees are expected to progress from the novice to mastery levels
in a particular set of professional competencies. This curriculum
applies the principles of competency-based medical education.

2. Program Durations
The Advanced Practice Nursing Program in Adult Critical Care is a
two-year program.
3. Program Rotations
Hospital rotations
Most critically ill patients are admitted to the ICU. Therefore, to
experience the role of adult critical care nurses, trainees are provided
with adequate specialty experience, irrespective of the name of the
ICU rotations in their respective training centers. Consequently, the
following program rotations were considered mandatory.
See Appendix A for further description of each rotation.
