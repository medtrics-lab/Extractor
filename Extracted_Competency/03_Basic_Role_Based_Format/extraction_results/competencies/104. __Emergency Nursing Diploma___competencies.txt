VIII. LEARNING AND
COMPETENCIES
1. Introduction to Learning Outcomes and
Competency-Based Education
Training should be guided by well-defined learning objectives that are
specific specialty needs. Learning outcomes are supposed to reflect the
trainees upon graduation. This will ensure that graduates meet the
to their specialty. Competency-based education (CBE) is an approach of
adult-learning that is based on achieving pre-defined, fine-grained, and
well-paced learning objectives driven by complex professional
competencies.
Professional competencies related to healthcare are usually complex,
involving multiple learning domains (knowledge, skills, and attitude). CBE
is expected to change the conventional format of postgraduate education.
For instance, the time of training, though a precious resource, should not
be considered as a proxy for competence (e.g., time of rotation in certain
hospital areas is not the primary marker of competence achievement).
Furthermore, CBE emphasizes the critical role of informed judgment in
learners’ competency progress, which is based on a staged and formative
assessment that is driven by multiple workplace-based observations.
Several CBE models have been developed for postgraduate education in
healthcare (e.g., the Royal College of Nursing’s National Curriculum and

Competency Framework for Emergency Nursing). The following concepts
enhance the implementation of CBE in this curriculum:
Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses the
of the profession. Professional roles (e.g., experts, advocates,
communicators, leaders, scholars, collaborators, and professionals) are
and assessment.
Milestones: Milestones are the stages of the developmental journey
through the competency continuum. Throughout their learning journey,
from junior to senior levels, trainees will be assisted to transform
themselves form novice/supervised to master/unsupervised
practitioners. This should not undermine the role of
supervisory/regulatory bodies towards malpractice of independent
practitioners. Milestones are expected to enhance the learning process
by pacing training/assessment to match the developmental level of the
trainees (junior vs. senior).
Learning-Domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed to
(K=Knowledge, S=Skills, and A=Attitude). You may have more than one
annotation for a given learning outcome.
Content-area Categorization: It is advisable to categorize learning
outcomes in broad content areas related to the practice of a profession.
For example, diagnostic versus therapeutic, simple versus complex, and
urgent versus chronic.
The National Curriculum and Competency Framework for Emergency
Nursing by the Royal College of Nursing
(https://www.rcn.org.uk/professional-development/publications/pub-
005883) was used as a competency framework in this curriculum and
Benner’s theory of the stages of nursing clinical competence (1948) was

--- Page 20 ---
used as the competency level of the learning journey (https://nursing-
theory.org/theories-and-models/from-novice-to-expert.php).
This emergency nursing competency framework was selected after a
advanced clinical program. This competency framework had an inclusive
nursing competencies (Appendix A). These levels include:
1. Good nursing practice (GNP) that represents the core or center of the
framework. GNP forms the basis of all nursing care and is central to
the Nursing Midwifery Council Code (UK). The behaviors outlined in
GNP should be applied when approaching other competencies within
the framework.
2. Cross-cutting themes (CCT) that are generic themes applying to
patients in any emergency care setting, irrespective of their
presenting complaint. The cross-cutting themes (CCT) are grouped
into competencies related to eight themes.
3. Emergency care clinical domains (CD) that specify the competencies
required to care for emergency patients throughout their lifespan.
There are seven clinical domains.
2. Program Durations
To successfully obtain an Emergency Nursing Diploma, the candidate
must fulfil the following requirements:
1. They must complete the program which is of a period of two calendar
years.
2. Trainees may complete clinical rotations as an 8-hour shift per day,
excluding lunchtime, or as a 12-hour shift to complete no more than
48 hours per week.

3. They must be able to communicate in English as that will be the
language of instruction.
