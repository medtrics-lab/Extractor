VII. LEARNING AND
COMPETENCIES
1. Introduction to Learning Outcomes and
Competency-Based Education
Training should be guided by well-defined learning objectives that are
specific specialty needs. Learning outcomes should reflect the professional
graduation. This will ensure that graduates meet the expected demands of
the healthcare system and patient care in relation to their specialty.
Competency-based Education (CBE) is an approach of “adult-learning” that
is based on achieving pre-defined, fine-grained, and well-paced learning
objectives that are identified from complex professional competencies.
Competency-based Education, as an approach, is an intentionally designed
program through which students acquire knowledge, build skills and
demonstrate mastery of competencies. Trainees’ learning is at the core of
this approach. The CBE models that have been adopted for use in the
midwifery curriculum include the Millers Prism of Clinical Competence and
the International Confederation of Midwives (ICM) (2019) (Figure 1).

Figure 1: ICM competencies framework
concepts from the Millers Pyramid were applied to evaluate the clinical
competencies applied in this program.
Figure 2: Miller's pyramid of clinical competence
Miller's pyramid is usually described as having four levels: knows, knows
how, shows how, and does. This pyramid is based on progressive
development across a range of abilities measured in the workplace context.

--- Page 19 ---
Miller's pyramid is a way of ranking clinical competence in educational
settings, and as a framework, it distinguishes between knowledge at lower
levels and activity at higher levels. At the lower levels of the pyramid, the
competence. They develop this understanding through knowledge
transmission learning activities, such as lectures, reading, and
demonstrations. In order to assess our learners are achieving what we want
them to achieve, we should evaluate them in the setting that we expect them
to be delivered. Miller's ideas strive to define education based on its output
and not on its inputs. Higher levels have greater professional authenticity,
moving the trainee from a novice to an expert.
At the upper levels of the pyramid, the aim is to integrate the theory
(intellectual skills), psychomotor skills, and professional attitudes to
perform as competent health professionals in different contexts (Sahu,
Chattu and Rewatkar. 2019).
The following are concepts to enhance the implementation of CBE in this
curriculum:
• Competency: Competency is a cognitive construct that assesses the
standards of the profession. Professional roles (e.g., midwife, health
advocate, communicator, leader, scholar, collaborator, and professional)
learning and assessment.
• Milestones: Milestones are the stages of the developmental journey
throughout the competency continuum. Throughout their learning
journey from year 1 to year 2, trainees will be assisted in transforming
from being novice/supervised to expert/unsupervised practitioners. This
should not undermine the role of supervisory/regulatory bodies toward
malpractice of independent practitioners. Milestones are expected to

enhance the learning process by pacing training/assessment to match
the developmental level of the trainees.
• Learning-Domains: Whenever possible, efforts should be directed to
(K=Knowledge, S=Skills, and A=Attitude). You may have more than one
annotation for a given learning outcome.
• Content-area Categorization: It is advisable to categorize learning
profession. The midwifery curriculum specialty modules will be based
on the essential competencies for midwifery practice as per the ICM
competencies framework Figure 2.
• Trainees: Trainees are expected to progress from the novice to expert
level in a certain set of professional competencies. The SCFHS endorsed
the One 45 system to articulate professional competencies. The
curriculum applies the principles of competency –based education.
2. Program Duration
The Advanced midwifery diploma Program is a two-year program.
3. Program Rotations
Hospital rotations
Trainees were required to complete 13 blocks (1 block = 4 weeks) of
training each year. Clinical rotation covers all maternity units for trainees to
attain the relevant competencies.

*PD are authorized to allocate the trainees within units and departments
that assist in meeting the objectives required.
*PD are authorized to reallocate the number of weeks of training according
to the trainees' learning needs.
4. Mapping of learning objectives and competency
roles to programme rotations:
This section aims to match the competencies and objectives related to each
rotation. Trainees and trainers should work together to achieve these
objectives during teaching and formative assessment. Expectations from
trainees should evolve as the training level progresses (training stage and
milestones). (Appendices A and B, respectively).
